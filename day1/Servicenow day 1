		5)UI policies
			These too work on the client side and are an alternate to the manual client scripts
			Used mainly for
			a)making fields readonly
			b)making fields mandatory
			c)show/hide fields
			Client scripts execute first and then the ui policies execute.
			Users specify the ui policy action which governs the fields to be made mandatory,etc.
			These can be applied to tables and catalog items etc.

			UI policies usually execute based on conditions i.e onchange but there is a checkbox to execute them 
			onLoad 
			Description should be given for ui policies as they don't have a name field of their own and description is there name
